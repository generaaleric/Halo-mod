1 armour set-finished
17 weapons - 3 weapon`s done
1 npc-not started yet

because this is my first mod EVER its slow with NO C# coding skill its all messing about till it works
so im releasing it now when its part way finished and no bugs (as far as i know) present i will
continue working on it till its complete i have no idea what i do afterwards.
